# Project End Phase

For the Fontys University of Applied Sciences course ProEP, our team has come up with an idea to help restaurant owners reduce the physical contact with their clients during the lockdown time but still be able to attend them on location. By using our service, restaurants could reach higher employee and customer satisfaction, better budget management and also, be able to operate even if another lockdown is to happen.

The goal of this project is to make the management of a restaurant more flexible, quicker,and easier for all the stakeholders involved. Managers, employees,and consumers must all feel like separate part of a bigger system that enables them to interchange all their needs and desires quickly and error-free.
